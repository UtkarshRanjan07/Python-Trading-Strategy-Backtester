## Python Trading Strategy Analyzer

This Python project is designed to facilitate the backtesting of trading strategies and the analysis of their performance. The project is built entirely from scratch using Python as the primary programming language. 
The framework enables users to analyze various metrics to generate comprehensive reports on the performance of their trading strategies.

## Key Features
Step 1: Import Dependencies

The project imports necessary libraries including pandas for data manipulation, datetime for time-related operations, and plotly.graph_objects for visualization.
# Step 2: Load Data

The project loads CSV data into memory, allowing users to access and analyze trading data.
# Step 3: Extract Future Data

It extracts future trading data based on predefined logic.
# Step 4: Extract Option Data

The project extracts option trading data, distinguishing it from other types of trades.
# Calculate Moving Averages

Various moving average calculations are performed to aid in strategy analysis.
#Generate Trades

The framework generates trades based on predefined conditions and moving average crossovers.
# Exit Strategies

Exit strategies are implemented based on stop-loss, target points, and predefined timeframes.

## Usage Guidelines
Users can define their trading strategies by setting conditions for generating buy or sell signals.
The project provides flexibility in defining entry and exit points based on moving averages and other technical indicators.
Users can customize stop-loss and target points according to their risk appetite and trading objectives.
Limitations and Considerations
The accuracy and effectiveness of the trading strategy depend on the quality and relevance of the data used.
Moving average calculations may require sufficient historical data to generate meaningful insights.
The project assumes certain fixed values for stop-loss and target points, which users may need to adjust based on market conditions and individual preferences.
Statistical Analysis
The framework includes statistical analysis tools to evaluate the performance of trading strategies.
Metrics such as profit trades, loss trades, profit points, loss points, and profit-to-loss ratio are calculated to assess strategy effectiveness.
